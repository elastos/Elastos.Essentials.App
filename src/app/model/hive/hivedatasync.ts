/**
 * Helper class to easily backup, restore and synchronize application data, including

 * Sync contexts: they represent a "scope" for items of the same kind. For example, your application
 * may want to backup both a list of contact, and a "todo" list. In this case you would use two
 * sync contexts: one named "contacts", and the other one "todolist". Each sync context mau contain
 * only items that have the same data structure.
 *
 * Concept:
 * - Every time your application adds, edits or deletes an item in the local application data model,
 * this backup restore service should also be notified by calling methods such as upsertDatabaseEntry().
 * - sync() may be called when you think it's a good time to synchronize the local application with the vault
 * backup, or with other devices using the same DID. This operation could be time and network intensive.
 * - Implement the sync context callback (insertion, modification and deletion) in order to synchronize updates
 * coming from the vault backup.
